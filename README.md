 Strive Book Shop ðŸ“š
You are creating a shopping cart experience for an online marketplace.

Tasks:

<!-- Get all products from the API: https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/books -->

<!-- Display all the books using template literals and .forEach -->

<!-- Add a add to cart button next to each item -->

When this button is pressed, add the item to another list and change its styling

<!-- Add a skip button inside each card -->

When pressed, this button should hide the specific book from the page

Add a search bar. When the user types more than 3 characters, filter the content of the API response to only display the books with a matching (or partially matching) title (hint: use .filter)

Allow users to delete books from their cart

EXTRAS:
Add a empty cart button, to delete the whole list

Create a detail page: when the user clicks on a book, they get redirected to another page. Pass the ASIN as a query string.

In the detail page, show the details of the book matching the ASIN in the query string: use this endpoint: https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/books/your_id_here
